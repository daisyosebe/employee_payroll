# employee_payroll_tracker

When "Add employee" button you receive prompts for first name, last name, and salary.

After all three pieces of information are entered, you are asked if you want to add more employees. 

If you select OK, then you are prompted with the same questions. 

If you choose to cancel, then employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, 

and the console shows the average salary and a randomly picked employee.
